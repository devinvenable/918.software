          <p class="testimonial-text">"Devin, Your reputation precedes you but I am enthusiastic to provide you a glowing recommendation for services. I'm not sure what your potential client is looking for, but if they're looking for someone to provide them with sage development advice with an eye towards development that is comprehensive yet thoughtful and tailored they can look nowhere else besides you. I feel like the best recommendation is repeat use of your services and I'm a repeat customer---whether as the CTO for Retenant where you handled a piece of code that you had not created but yet perfectly managed or for my own personal start up, I can think of no better development partner. My only hope is that your potential customer doesn't use you for so long that you can't finish up my work."</p>
