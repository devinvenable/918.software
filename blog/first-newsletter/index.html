      <article class="blog-post-content">
        <p>
  When I was recently laid off from a full-time role, it hit me: I'd been
  replaced by AI.
</p>

<p>
  Let me explain. I was the founding engineer at a startup—my fifth time in that
  role during my career. Startups are risky, but rewarding. You get to build
  from scratch, but you're racing the clock. Most don't make it.
</p>

<p>
  In past startups, I was always the last one out. You need someone around who
  can put out fires, upgrade systems, and access the data. This time, I wasn't
  the last one out.
</p>

<p>
  I advocated for hiring a prompt engineer skilled in 'Vibe Coding,' a practice
  where users leverage AI prompts to build code, sometimes without fully
  grasping its mechanics. This individual's proactive approach and AI
  proficiency impressed me significantly. I communicated to leadership that
  their output, facilitated by AI, surpassed that of certain traditional
  engineers I've collaborated with.
</p>

<p>And then cuts came and I was the one to go.</p>

<p>
  No hard feelings. I get it—business is business. If they could get similar
  output from someone who costs less and shift budget toward sales, it made
  sense.
</p>

<p>
  Still, losing a salary stings. And for the first time in my career, finding
  the next thing wasn't instant. Development jobs in 2025 are harder to get.
</p>

<p>
  It's not just me. Big Tech saw massive layoffs in 2024—around 95,000 jobs
  cut—and it's still happening in 2025. Companies like Intel, Tesla, and Cisco
  scaled back after years of aggressive hiring.
</p>

    Development roles are changing dramatically in 2025
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  A lot of those cuts hit software engineers. The reasons vary—economic shifts,
  less venture capital—but AI is clearly part of the story. Salesforce has
  hinted at slowing down dev hiring thanks to AI productivity gains. Even
  Google's CEO said AI is now generating a big chunk of their code.
</p>

<p>It feels less like a blip—and more like a shift.</p>

<p>So, what next? What did I learn—and how would I pivot?</p>

<p>
  While I've long been an advocate for AI, I remain passionate about writing
  code. Though I've consistently been a highly productive developer—a
  demonstrable fact, not a boast—I recognize that even my expertise cannot match
  the speed of a machine. Therefore, I've decided to prioritize English as my
  primary programming interface.
</p>

<p>
  The result? In the past five weeks, I've built a lot. With my experience and a
  lightning-fast AI sidekick, progress is real.
</p>

<h3>No-Job.Dev</h3>
<p>
  One project is <a href="https://no-job.dev">no-job.dev</a>—a space for
  developers out of work. I saw so many devs on LinkedIn saying they were months
  into a job hunt with no luck. That's a lot of noise for a platform not built
  for that kind of vulnerability, so I launched a site to give it a home.
</p>

<div class="image-container">

    alt="no-job.dev screenshot"
  />

  <div class="image-caption">What to expect when you weren't expecting</div>
</div>

<p>
  In 2023, there were over 1.6 million software devs in the U.S. I think we're
  on the edge of a major shift—especially for those not embracing AI. No-job.dev
  is early, but I'm building it to be ready for that shift.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, over at 918.software, the lab is buzzing. We’re prototyping a
  booking app for pool cleaners (because even robots need a clean swim),
  tinkering with a blockchain-based private messenger (for when you want privacy
  and receipts), and smoothing out the chaos of social media with tools that
  make Instagram patterns easier to repurpose elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
  There’s also a lightweight video clip editor in the works—built for fast,
  no-fuss storytelling—and we’re deep in the weeds distilling large language
  models into something leaner and meaner for custom use cases.
</p>

<p>
  This is what happens when you give a builder AI superpowers and a little free
  time.
</p>

<p>
  We're also shifting from just custom dev work to helping teams train AI,
  integrate it, and automate workflows.
</p>

<p>
  If you're into this stuff, I'd love to keep you on the newsletter. But no
  pressure—opt out anytime.
</p>

<p>
  Peace,<br />
