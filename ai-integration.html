        <div class="section-content">
          <p>There's a lot of noise about AI right now. Most of it is hype. But underneath the hype, there are real tools that can save time and reduce manual work — if they're applied to the right problems.</p>
          <p>I don't lead with AI. But when it fits — extracting data from documents, drafting repetitive content, answering common questions — I'll use it. And I'll be honest when it doesn't fit.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Why Experience Matters Here</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>Anyone can demo an AI tool. Building something that actually works in your business — that connects to your systems, handles edge cases, and doesn't break when the data gets messy — that's different.</p>
          <p>I've built these kinds of integrations manually for 20+ years: data pipelines, system integrations, workflow automation. I know how they fail. AI makes some of this faster, but it doesn't replace the judgment of someone who's done it the hard way.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Start with the problem:</strong> AI is only useful if it solves something real. We figure that out first.</li>
            <li><strong>Small pilots:</strong> I don't recommend betting big on AI. Try it on one workflow, see if it works, then expand.</li>
            <li><strong>Guardrails built in:</strong> AI makes mistakes. I build in human review where it matters.</li>
            <li><strong>Production-grade:</strong> Not a demo. Not a prototype. Something your team can rely on.</li>
          </ul>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>We talk:</strong> You tell me what's frustrating. I ask questions to find where AI might actually help.</li>
            <li><strong>I scope it:</strong> Clear proposal — what I'll build, what it costs, what "done" looks like.</li>
            <li><strong>Small pilot first:</strong> We test on one workflow before expanding. Lower risk, faster learning.</li>
            <li><strong>You use it:</strong> I hand it off with documentation and make sure your team is comfortable.</li>
            <li><strong>We iterate:</strong> AI improves with feedback. I stick around to tune and expand.</li>

          <p class="testimonial-text">"Devin, Your reputation precedes you but I am enthusiastic to provide you a glowing recommendation for services. I'm not sure what your potential client is looking for, but if they're looking for someone to provide them with sage development advice with an eye towards development that is comprehensive yet thoughtful and tailored they can look nowhere else besides you. I feel like the best recommendation is repeat use of your services and I'm a repeat customer---whether as the CTO for Retenant where you handled a piece of code that you had not created but yet perfectly managed or for my own personal start up, I can think of no better development partner. My only hope is that your potential customer doesn't use you for so long that you can't finish up my work."</p>
