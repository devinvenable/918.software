# Chat Work Summary - March 26, 2025

## Overview
Today we identified and fixed broken/placeholder links in the 918.software website by creating fully-formed content pages for resources that were previously just placeholders. We then enhanced one of those pages with additional content.

## Specific Tasks Completed

### 1. Identified Placeholder Links
We found several links in the website that were using placeholder URLs (`href="#"`), specifically:
- "10 Ways Real Estate Firms Can Use AI Today" 
- "The Executive's Guide to Effective AI Implementation" 
- "Prompt Engineering: From Basics to Advanced Techniques" 
- "Case Study: How a Marketing Agency Saved 30+ Hours Per Week with AI"

These were all resource links in the AI Training section of the website that didn't point to actual HTML files.

### 2. Created Content for Missing Resources
We created comprehensive HTML pages for each of the missing resources:
- `real-estate-ai.html`: Detailed guide on 10 ways real estate firms can use AI
- `executive-ai-guide.html`: Strategic framework for AI implementation aimed at executives
- `prompt-engineering-guide.html`: Complete guide to prompt engineering from basics to advanced techniques
- `marketing-agency-case-study.html`: Case study of a marketing agency that saved significant time using AI

Each page included:
- Properly structured HTML with consistent navigation
- In-depth content with sections and implementation tips
- Visual elements (icons, formatting) to enhance readability
- Links back to the main AI Training page

### 3. Updated Links in AI Training Page
We updated the links in `ai-training.html` to point to the newly created resource pages, replacing the placeholder `href="#"` links with the actual file paths.

### 4. Fixed CSS Syntax Issue
We identified and fixed a CSS syntax issue in the `marketing-agency-case-study.html` file, specifically with a Unicode character in the CSS that was causing lint errors.

### 5. Enhanced Real Estate AI Content
We improved the "10 Ways Real Estate Firms Can Use AI Today" page by merging the best content from the existing version with new content provided, resulting in more comprehensive descriptions while preserving the practical implementation tips.

## Results
The website now has four complete, substantive resource pages that were previously just placeholder links. These pages provide valuable information for visitors and enhance the overall user experience of the site. The content is aligned with 918.software's focus on AI integration, workflow automation, and AI training.
